===========================

we are writing this code to check the test case. while you are the writing the script on working area and suddenly you got issue on prod env then you need to switch prod env and work on prod and fix the issue.

Usually in this case with out commiting the updated code it will not allow the swich to another branch but there is a one option called stash. if we entered stash command it will create backup on local repo..
after you fix the issue in prod env and back to your work..
